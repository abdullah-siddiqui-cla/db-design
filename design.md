# Step 1: Identify Entities
Based on the requirements, the main entities are:

### Books
- `id` (Primary Key) - Integer
- `Title` - String/Text
- `Genre` - String/Text
- `PublicationYear` - Integer

### Authors
- `id` (Primary Key) - Integer
- `Name` - String/Text

### Members
- `id` (Primary Key) - Integer
- `Name` - String/Text
- `Contact` - String/Text
- `MembershipDate` - Date

### Transactions
- `id` (Primary Key) - Integer
- `BorrowDate` - Date
- `ReturnDate` - Date


# Step 2: Define Relationships

## Each book can have multiple authors (Books ↔ Authors: Many-to-Many)
Create `BookAuthors` to model the many-to-many relationship between Books and Authors

### BookAuthors
- `BookID` (Foreign Key) - Integer
- `AuthorID` (Foreign Key) - Integer

## A member can borrow multiple books (Members ↔ Transactions: One-to-Many).
Add `BookID` (Foreign Key) inside the `Transactions` table which will contain the `ID` of book.

## Each borrowing transaction is associated with one book (Books ↔ Transactions: One-to-Many).
Add `MemberID` (Foreign Key) inside the `Transactions` table which will contain the `ID` of a member.
